            <h2> DAQ Overview</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                The DAQ project was a project that supports a FSAE(Formula SAE) style car. The DAQ would acquire data from sensors that were connected to the car and convert it to a csv file that can be used 
                to interpret data from sensors. The project was a based on a stm32 f4(f429) that would breakout to multiple different types of communication protocols that consisted of I2C,SPI,UART,CAN,and USB

                <summary>Schematic overview</summary>
                <img src ="images/DAQpage1Schematic.PNG" class = "center" width=" 50%" height=" 75%">
                <div class = "rounded">
                    <p>The first page of the schematic consisted of essentials needed to get the custom stm32 board working. This primarily included boot0,NRST,VCAP_1, and VCAP_2. </p>
                    <h2>NRST</h2>
                        <p>the NRST pin is the reset pin of the MCU and is connected to a push button connected to ground so the user can reset the MCU if need be. There is also a debouncing capacitor connected to the pushbutton to ensure 
                            that the button press isn't accidentally registered again after the release of the button.
                        </p>
                    <h2>BOOT0</h2>
                        <p> this is the pin that selects whether or not the MCU is going to boot from flash memory or from system memory. a SPDT is used to select how to MCU will boot.
                        </p>
                    <h2>Vcap</h2>
                        <p>These pins are for the MCU's internal voltage regulator and are used to filter the regulator. The recommend values from the stm32f429 datasheet were used for these. Which was 2.2uF with the additional specification that the ESR of the capacitors where less than 2 ohms
                        </p>
                    <h2>HSE(high speed external) oscillator</h2>
                        <img src ="images/DAQHSEPNG.PNG" class = "center" width="75%" height=" 50%">
                        <p>the HSE utilizes a Pierce oscillator design, however, the inverter and the resistor of the circuit is incorporated inside the MCU. The only parts that need to be designed and values picked 
                            are the two capacitors and the crystal in the Pierce oscillator. a 0 ohm resistor is added to adjust current levels if needed. the values of the capacitor were based on the stray capacitance(which was assumed to be 5 pf) and the load capacitance of crystal that was chosen
                            below is the equation used to calculate c1 and c2 where Cs is stray capacitance and Cl is load capacitance which was taken from stm32's AN2867 application notes.
                        </p>

                    <h2>Decoupling capacitor</h2>
                        <p>The number of decoupling capacitors and their value were based on the recommendations from the stm32F429 datasheet which basically recommended one decoupling capacitor for every
                            physical VCC pin and a additional bulk decoupling capacitor. All decoupling capacitors were 100nF with the exception of bulk decoupling capacitors which was 4.7uF for digital Vcc pins and 
                            1uF for the Analog Vcc pin
                        </p>
                    <h2>Power</h2>
                        <img src="images/DAQPower.PNG" class ="center">
                        <p> The Power section is rather simple as the PCB only needs 5v and 3.3v power is taken from a USB then the Vbus is connected to a AMS1117 voltage regulator which is a fixed 3.3v LDO. Decoupling capacitors are used both the input and output of the AMS1117. This particular setup for the AMS117 was take from a example setup of the AMS1117 from the datasheet. 
                            5v from the USB would be used primarily for the CAN transceiver IC and would also be paired with connectors for digital communications like I2C,UART,SPI,etc to provide power to sensors or other devices hooked to these communication protocols. 3.3v would be used to power the MCU and control MCU functions like BOOT0 or the pullup resistors on I2C lines.Note that the use a 2.2k resistor for the current limiter resistor is based on the fact that 
                            I previously used 2.2k resistor in the schematic so reused part values to make creating the BOM less of a headache. 
                        </p>
                    <h2>communication</h2> 
                        <img src ="images/DAQConnectors.PNG" class = "center" width=" 100%" height=" 75%" ><i> above is a picture of the whole schematic page for communcation for the DAQ </i></img>
                        <h2>I2C</h2>
                            <p>Due to I2C being an open-drain configuration for both the SDA and SCL lines pull up resistors are needed to bring the logic level back up to Vcc. With that said, the value of the pull-up resistor will impact how fast the I2C line will be able to oscillate so picking a proper value pull-up resistor is necessary to ensure that the SDA and SCL lines operate at their given frequency. using the tried and true method of googling values for pull-up resistors I settled with 2.2k resistors.
                                I came to this conclusion simply because i wasn't sure if the I2C lines would be used in standard mode(100 kbit/s) or in fast mode(400 kbit/s) so to ensure compatibility with both i settled with a lower value of resistance. However, the drawback would be that there would be more power dissapted by the resistors and lead to a less power efficient I2C line however I think this tradeoff was worth it guaranteed compatibility with either standard or fast mode I2C.
                            </p>
                        <h2>USB</h2>
                            <p>Used USB A connector to send data packets. USB was routed via differential pairs with a differential impedance of 90 Ohms this particular revision of the DAQ doesn't have ESD protection however in other revision the USB data lines would go through a ESD Protection IC first then into the USB data lines on the MCU. Vbus would be connected to the voltage regulator, ID pin would not be connected and both shield and gnd would be connected to ground.  </p>
                        <h2>CAN</h2>
                            <img src ="images/DAQCAN.PNG" class ="center" width = "75%" height="50%">
                            <p> CAN is wired similar to the USB connector but instead has a 120 ohm termination resistor on the begining and end of the CAN bus. in addition, the differential pairs would also have a differential impedance of 120 Ohms. This CAN differential pair would then connect to a TJA1051 CAN transciever then into the MCU </p>

                <summary> PCB layout</summary>
                <img src = "images/DAQ.PNG" width = "100%" height ="75%">
                <h2>Physical Layot</h2>
                    <p> the PCB was a 4 layer PCB that had a stack up of signal, power, ground, signal (the order is from top to bottom layer). The power plane is separated into two different parts for 3.3v components and 5v components. Majority of the signals are routed on the top layer with the bottom signal layer used primarily when the signals couldn't be routed from the top layer. There were some attempts to isolate analog signals from digital signals with all analog signals being in a section isolated from the other digital communications.However there are some GPIO pins next to the the Analog pins however these pins are intended for error handling and statues(i.e error LEDs and Status LEDs). </p>
                <h2>Connectors pinout</h2>
                    <p> molex connectors were used primarily due to their locking nature and size. I wasn't sure how difficult it would be to trouble shoot the board so I used larger Molex connectors to make pins larger and more accessible for trouble shooting. in addition each molex connector is 6 pins 5v would always be found on pin 4 and ground would always be on pin 6 of the connector.</p>
                <h2>Differential pairs</h2>
                    <p> since the board contained both USB and CAN differential pairs were required to route both of these connectors. I didn't find too much information on how to calculte differential pair measurments but so I wend ahead and used KiCad's build in transmission line calculator and measure the width and spacing for a coupled microstrip line to find the differential impedance required for USB and CAN. since I'm using Fr4
                        as my PCB substrate so i used 4.5 as the relative permitivity constant. USB differential impedance was set to 90 Ω and CAN bus was 120 Ω impedance.
                    </p>
                <h2>Power</h2>
                    <p>Power came from a USB C connector that fed to an ams1117 fixed 3.3 LDO voltage regulator. All the routing from usb and voltage regulator are done on the top signal layer then the use of vias are used to connect them voltages to their respective plane in the power plane. In hindsight maybe the power section was a little too close to the analog section but the use of a voltage regulator didn't bring too much noise to the system.
                    </p>
                <h2>decoupling capacitor and oscillators</h2>
                    <p>due to recommendation from the data sheet both the oscillator and decoupling capacitors were routed first they had requirements of needing to be rather close to the MCU. With that said, decoupling capacitors were place very close to their corresponding Vcc pin on the MCU and had vias that connect to 3.3v and gnd right next to the which is based on the given example from the stm32 AN4938 application note
                    </p>
